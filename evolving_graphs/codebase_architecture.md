# Detailed Codebase Architecture

### 1. Overall System Purpose

This system is designed to manage and enforce a specific architectural pattern within a software project. It comprises two core components: an agent orchestration system that executes individual agents in a goal-oriented manner and a comprehensive code linter that ensures adherence to a flat architecture, identifying and reporting violations across the codebase. The system aims to provide a streamlined workflow for both agent execution and architectural compliance.

### 2. Architectural Entry Points

*   `agent_graph.agent_graph_main`: Responsible for initiating and controlling the execution of an agent within a goal-oriented system.
*   `linter_graph.linter_graph_main`: Responsible for orchestrating a collection of code linting functions to ensure adherence to a flat architectural pattern, identifying and reporting violations.

### 3. Detailed Workflow Analysis

#### 1. `agent_graph.agent_graph_main`

1.  The process begins in `agent_graph.agent_graph_main`.
2.  It receives a goal string from the command line.
3.  It instantiates an `Agent` object from `agent_core.agent_core`.
4.  The `Agent` object's `run_with_agent()` method is called.
5.  Inside `run_with_agent()`, the `Agent` class performs the following steps:
    *   It sets the goal string received from the command line.
    *   It initializes its internal state.
    *   It loops repeatedly, awaiting external events (presumably, via some form of event loop mechanism not detailed in the summaries).
    *   Within the loop, it evaluates the current goal state to determine the next action.
    *   It executes the action determined by the goal evaluation.
    *   This cycle repeats until the goal is achieved or a termination condition is met.

#### 2. `linter_graph.linter_graph_main`

1.  The process starts with `linter_graph.linter_graph_main`.
2.  It calls `parse_arguments()` from `linter_graph.linter_graph_main`. This function handles command-line argument parsing.
3.  `parse_arguments()` determines the scope of linting: individual files, directories, or the entire project.
4.  `parse_arguments()` then calls `collect_target_files()` from `linter_graph.linter_graph_main`.
5.  `collect_target_files()` determines the files to be linted. If no input is provided, it defaults to linting files within the "evolving_graphs" folder.
6.  `collect_target_files()` passes the collected file paths to the `main()` function also from `linter_graph.linter_graph_main`.
7.  `main()` is called. This is the core execution driver.
8.  `main()` performs the following:
    *   It iterates through the collected files.
    *   For each file, it imports the necessary linting rule checks from the relevant modules: `linter_rules_recovery`, `check_import_comments`, `check_imports_compliance`, `check_duplication`, `check_file_sizes`, `check_init_files`, `check_entry_points`, `check_orchestrator_pattern`, and `check_cross_graph_imports`.
    *   It calls the corresponding check functions for each file.
    *   The `check_final_compliance` function, leveraging the previously called checks, determines if the architectural pattern has been successfully maintained.
9.  `check_final_compliance` then communicates the verification result (success or failure) to the caller.

### 4. Key Data Structures & Concepts

*   **Backpack:** This data structure (likely a custom class or data object) is used by the `Agent` (from `agent_core.agent_core`) to temporarily store files and other related information that are relevant to its current goal. It's essentially a temporary container for items that will be processed by the agent.
*   **Plan:**  The `Plan` object (potentially created by a `Planner` module â€“ although not explicitly detailed) holds a strategic blueprint for the agent's execution. It likely contains information about the sequence of actions to be taken, resource allocation, and other relevant details.
*   **Verification Result:**  This is a boolean (or equivalent) data type representing the outcome of a linting check or architectural compliance verification. A value of `True` indicates success (the rule is satisfied), while `False` indicates a violation. This result is communicated between the `linter_graph.linter_graph_main` and the `check_final_compliance` function.
