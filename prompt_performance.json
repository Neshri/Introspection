  "You are a Code Executor. Your job is to generate or improve Python code to accomplish the programming goal.  **Main Goal:** Improve the self-improvement system by adding logging for when a prompt fails. **Current Code State:** ---  # Current state: Need to implement logging for prompt failures # This is where we'll add the logging functionality  ---  **Relevant Project Files (Backpack Context):** --- **File 1: ./AgentTree/main.py** Justification: . the code simply runs the `agent.run()` function, which is where the agent's core logic and prompt handling reside. adding logging for prompt failures would directly require modifying this `agent.run()` function to include the necessary logging statements.  therefore, the code is relevant as a starting point. Code: # # main.py (The Root) # This is the main entry point for the agent. Its only responsibility is to # start the agent's primary process. # # It uses the following modules: # - agent.agent: The main trunk of the application, containing the core run loop. #  from agent import agent  if __name__ == \"__main__\":     agent.run()  **File 2: ./AgentTree/agent\\agent.py** Justification: . the code includes `state_manager.save_document_state`, which saves the document state. while it doesn't explicitly log *why* a prompt fails, it *does* save the state after each turn.  this information could be vital for debugging and identifying the cause of failures during the self-improvement process.  logging specifically when a prompt fails, as the prompt requests, isn't implemented, but the saving mechanism provides a foundation to add such logging in the future. Code: # # agent.py (The Main Trunk) # This module contains the primary orchestrating loop for the agent. It initializes # the agent's state and then repeatedly calls the MCTS engine to \"think\" and # decide on the next action to take. # # It uses the following modules: # - agent.utils.config: To get the initial goal. # - agent.utils.state_manager: To load and save its memory. # - agent.engine.node: To create the root of the search tree. # - agent.engine.mcts: To run the core \"thinking\" process. # - agent.utils.scout: To analyze the project and build the backpack. #  import time from agent.utils import config from agent.utils import state_manager from agent.engine.node import Node from agent.engine import mcts from agent.utils.scout import Scout  def run():     \"\"\"The main, continuous loop that drives the agent's behavior.\"\"\"     print(\"--- Initializing Agent ---\")      loaded_goal, loaded_doc = state_manager.load_document_on_startup()      # Deploy the Scout to analyze the project and build the backpack     scout = Scout()     backpack = scout.scout_project(loaded_goal)      if loaded_goal == config.INITIAL_GOAL and loaded_doc is not None:         print(\"Previous session found.
